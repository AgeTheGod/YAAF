#   What is Generative AI?

... and why should architects care about it?

AI Is Not A Person - it is a tool that can be used by people to do things that they couldn't do before or to do things faster or better than they could do before. It is not a replacement for human intelligence but rather an augmentation of it.

It's better to consider it as a 5th Generation Language

>    4GL refers to fourth Generation Language which was supposed to be a step closer to computers doing what I meant them to do, not what I said. The idea was that languages like C, C++, Java, were all based on telling a computer how to do something. These were the 3GL (third Generation Language) which encapsulated low level functionality in higher level abstraction in the way they controlled the computer. The next generation of languages would move further away from the computer and more into the solving of problems. Basically, it would be easier to teach subject matter experts to program, than it would be to teach programmers to be experts in the subject. What happened? We were supposed to be experts who used computers to do some tasks, but we have become computer experts who try to learn about all sorts of subjects.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth-generation_programming_language)
>   While fourth-generation programming languages are designed to build specific programs, fifth-generation languages are designed to make the computer solve a given problem without the programmer. This way, the user only needs to worry about what problems need to be solved and what conditions need to be met, without worrying about how to implement a routine or algorithm to solve them. Fifth-generation languages are used mainly in artificial intelligence research. OPS5 and Mercury are examples of fifth-generation languages,[2] as is ICAD, which was built upon Lisp. KL-ONE is an example of a related idea, a frame language.
