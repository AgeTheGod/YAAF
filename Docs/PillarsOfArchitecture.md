##  The Pillars (or P's) of Architecture

The content of  this repository is based on the Pillars of Architecture which are:
-  **Perspectives** - Different views of the architecture from different stakeholder roles
-  **Patterns** - Reusable solutions to common architecture problems
-  **Principles** - Guiding rules and best practices for architecture development
-  **Practices** - Established methods and techniques for architecture development
-  **Products** - Different types of artifacts and deliverables produced during the architecture process
-  **Processes** - Different activities and tasks performed during the architecture process

There are other P's that could be included e.g. Plans, Phases, People, Platforms, etc. but I think the above are the most important ones to focus on when defining an architecture framework. Plans and Phases in particular are really Project Management topics and dictated by the development approach being taken.
Platforms are of course important but they tend to be more relevant at the Technical Architecture level rather than the Application Architecture level and do not (or should not) change what an application does and the outcomes it produces.

## Perspectives - Zachman Framework

The [Zachman Framework](https://zachman-feac.com/zachman/about-the-zachman-framework) is one of the most widely recognized enterprise architecture frameworks. It provides a structured way of viewing and defining an enterprise from different perspectives and aspects i.e. it's an Ontology for classifying Artefacts that are created and maintained during the lifecycle of an Organization, Application or System.

| Perspective (Role)          |               What |                 How |                Where |                      Who |               When |                      Why |
|-----------------------------|-------------------:|--------------------:|---------------------:|-------------------------:|-------------------:|-------------------------:|
| Contextual (Identification) |     Inventory list |     Major processes |        Locations map |                Org units |     Business cycle |           Business goals |
| Conceptual (Definition)     |  Business entities |        Value chains |           Site model |         Stakeholder list |        Event model |      Business objectives |
| Logical (Representation)    | Logical data model |       Process flows |   Distribution model | Roles & responsibilities |       Timing rules |           Business rules |
| Physical (Specification)    |    Physical schema |  Application design |     Network topology |            System owners |          Schedules | Implementation rationale |
| Detailed (Configuration)    |  Table definitions |        Code modules | Deployment artifacts |     Component interfaces | Transaction timing |        Detailed policies |
| Functioning (Instantiation) |       Runtime data | Executing processes |     Production sites |             Active users |   Operational logs |        Measured outcomes |

### Products - Architecture Artifacts

Different types of artifacts and deliverables produced during the architecture process

This is the purpose of a Meta-Model - to define the types of artifacts and deliverables that are produced during the architecture process and the significant details we need to captute about those artifacts in order to manage them effectively.

### Processes

Different activities and tasks performed during the architecture process

### Patterns

Reusable solutions to common architectural problems

### Principles

Guiding rules and best practices for architecture development

### Practices

Established methods and techniques for architecture development
