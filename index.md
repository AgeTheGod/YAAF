##  Motivation

So why does the world need yet another architecture framework?

The honest answer is that it doesn't really need one except that I think the emergence Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Software Engineering has fundamentally changed the way that all I.T. Architecture will be done in the future.

Hence, we need to think about evolving an approach that incorporate these new technologies and optimise their benefits in a coherent way whilst minimising their risks and downsides.

Luckily, I'm firmly of the belief that Architecture should be driven by usable Specifications and Models i.e. statements of requirements that can be directly implemented as part of a solution rather than just being abstract representations of some aspect of the solution.

In addition (and this is important) I also like to boil things down to a bare minimum and avoid doing unnecessary work by re-using existing models and artifacts wherever possible. I'm really not a fan of "blank paper architecture".

On that point it's worth bearing in mind that AI tools are very, very good at re-using existing content and artifacts to create new ones so if we can define a framework that encourages re-use then we can leverage AI tools to do a lot of the heavy lifting for us.

So, given all that, what will be found here is not a new an Architectural Framework _per se_ but lots of opinion about what an Enterprise or Application Architect should be doing to maximise the benefit of AI and how they should be doing it in the future.

Hopefully some of this is of use to someone else and if not then at least it will be of use to me as a reference for my own work.

##  Repository Organization

The repository is organized into several sub-directories that each focuses on a specific aspect of architecture, providing insights, best practices, and reusable solutions.

These are the main directories and generally what is in them:

| Directory                         | Description                                                                             |
