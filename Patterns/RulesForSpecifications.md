#   Rules For Specifications

In some ways this is a blast from the past during my days as a Business Analyst when I was writing a lot of specifications for various kinds of applications whichg in those days including writing formal work-flow specifications as well as defining data requirements.

The rules are pretty simple and are based on the idea that a specification should be clear, concise, and unambiguous.

1. **Use clear and concise language**: Avoid jargon and technical terms that may not be understood by all stakeholders. Use simple and straightforward language to ensure that everyone can understand the specification.
2. **Be specific**: Avoid vague statements and be as specific as possible about what is required. This will help to avoid misunderstandings and ensure that everyone is on the same page.
6. **Specify the key requirements first**: We should all know what a Minimum Viable Product is and that's what should be done first  to deliver value to the stakeholders as quickly as possible.
7. **Use consistent terminology**: Use consistent terminology throughout the specification to avoid confusion and ensure that everyone is using the same language to describe the requirements. This can help to avoid misunderstandings and ensure that everyone is on the same page.
3. **Use examples for use cases**: Provide examples to illustrate your points and make it easier for stakeholders to understand the requirements. This can help to clarify any ambiguities and ensure that everyone has a clear understanding of what is required.
5. **Use diagrams**: Use diagrams to visually represent the requirements and make it easier for stakeholders to understand the relationships between different components. This can help to clarify complex requirements and ensure that everyone has a clear understanding of how the different components fit together.
8. **Use a standard format**: Use a standard format for the specification to ensure that it is easy to read and understand. 
9. **Include acceptance criteria**: Include acceptance criteria alongside the specification to define how the requirements will be tested and validated. This can help to ensure that the requirements are met and that the solution meets the needs of the stakeholders.
10. **Use version control**: Use version control to track changes to the specification and ensure that everyone is working with the most up-to-date **_agreed_** version. This can help to avoid confusion and ensure that everyone is on the same page.
