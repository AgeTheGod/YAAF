title: Enumerated Values
---

This is a topic that regularly comes up in discussions about data modelling and the use of "Enumerated Values" or "Enumerations" in a data model.

The problem is that different programmin g languages have varying definitions of what an "Enumeration" is and how it should be used. 

In some languages it's a simple list of values that can be used as a data type for an attribute in a class. In other languages it's a more complex construct that can have methods and properties of its own.
