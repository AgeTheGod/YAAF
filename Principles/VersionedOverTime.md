#   Versioned Over Time

A principle that emphasizes the importance of maintaining multiple versions of data, documents, or software over time to ensure historical accuracy, traceability, and the ability to revert to previous states when necessary. This approach is crucial in various fields such as software development, data management, and content creation.

Versioning allows for the tracking of changes, updates, and modifications, providing a clear history of how an item has evolved. 
It enables collaboration among multiple contributors by allowing them to work on different versions simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes.
