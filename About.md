The website [EA Frameworks](https://www.enterprise-architecture.org/ea-frameworks/) lists over 900 Architecture Frameworks and although many of them are purpose specific variations of some common framework (TOGAF variants are popular) it's still an awful lot.

I even started one myself with Simon Watts (RIP) way back on the 2000's called "**Objective Architecture**" and wrote a quarterly column for TDAN called "_Architecture is Objective, Design is Subjective_" where I discussed various aspects of (mostly) Application Architecture and particularly Data Architecture.
It's always been my belief that all Application Architecture should be Objective based i.e. there must be a clearly defined reason for doing something with a clearly defined outcome for doing it.

it based on 30+ years of designing and building many kinds of applications for many kinds of organizations for many kinds of business purposes.
