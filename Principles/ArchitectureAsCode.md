#   Architecture As Code

"_Architecture As Code_" is really a misnomer as what we are really talking about is "Architecture As Information" because information is really what we are trying to capture and manage.

Whilst visual representations can be useful for communication and understanding, they often lack the depth and detail needed to fully capture the complexities of the subject area being described and, evcen worse, are frequently produced in a  (mostly binary) format that makes them unusable for anything other than to show people. 
Binary pictures are pretty much unusable as input to actual systems development work.

This is important because I've always considered the tendency to produce "_pretty pictures_" as the primary artifacts of architecture work as a wasdte of everyones time.
