#   Suitable Approaches



##  Domain Decomposition

I did my BSc and MSc way back in the mists of time (the 1980 & 1990's) when most application development was focussed on Structured Systems Analysis and Design.

However, things evolve and over the years I've picked up various other ideas and concepts that I think are important to include in any Architecture Framework so here are some of the key ones:

|Term|Abbreviation|Definition|
|----|------------|----------|
|Business Information Model|BIM|A high-level conceptual model that defines the key business entities, their attributes, and relationships within a specific domain or organization. The BIM serves as a bridge between business stakeholders and technical teams, providing a common understanding of the data requirements and structure needed to support business processes and objectives.|
|Domain Driven Design|DDD|An approach to software development that emphasizes the importance of understanding and modeling the core business domain. DDD encourages collaboration between domain experts and developers to create a shared language and a rich model that accurately reflects the business processes and rules. This model is then used to guide the design and implementation of software systems, ensuring that they align closely with business needs.|
|C4 Model|C4|A hierarchical approach to visualizing software architecture, consisting of four levels of abstraction: Context, Container, Component, and Code. The C4 Model provides a clear and structured way to communicate the architecture of a software system to different stakeholders, from high-level overviews to detailed technical designs.|
|Model Driven Engineering|MDE|A software development approach that focuses on creating and exploiting domain models as primary artifacts in the development process. MDE emphasizes the use of models to generate code, documentation, and other artifacts, allowing for higher levels of abstraction and automation. This approach aims to improve productivity, maintainability, and alignment with business requirements by reducing manual coding and promoting model consistency.|
|Consumer Driven Contracts|CDC|A design approach that focuses on defining and managing the interactions between services or components based on the needs and expectations of the consumers (clients) of those services. CDC emphasizes the importance of clear and explicit contracts that specify the behavior, data formats, and communication protocols required by consumers, allowing for better decoupling, flexibility, and evolution of services over time.|
